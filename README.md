# Privkeys.eth

🧬 A rogue entropy scanner designed for Windows, built to surface rare Ethereum keys through immersive HUD overlays, plugin-powered rituals, and collectible shard output.

Privkeys.eth turns raw entropy into lore—each scan a ritual, each rare hit a fragment from the mythic void.

## 🔍 Core Features

- 🧩 Plugin-enabled HUD with toggles like `ShardSweeper`
- 💠 Rare key detection with funded wallet tagging
- 📊 Live entropy metrics and session statistics
- 🗃 Offline-first binary—no telemetry, no network dependencies
- ⚡ Packaged for rapid execution across local environments

---

## 📦 Installation

Download the latest Windows executable from the shard vault:  
[📥 privkeys.exe via Smash](https://fromsmash.com/privkeys)

> ⚠️ **Heads up:** This `.exe` file is unsigned and locally compiled. Browsers or antivirus tools may flag it as “potentially unsafe.”  
> It's clean, telemetry-free, and designed for local execution. Feel free to sandbox, scan, or inspect before launch. Builders trust builders.

Once downloaded, run the binary and enter the entropy tunnel. Each scan may yield keys, fragments, or anomalies.

## 🚧 Roadmap

- 🔁 Plugin architecture v2 (with chainable rituals + shard metadata)
- 🧙 Lore triggers and modal overlays during entropy events
- 🌐 `.zip` and `.torrent` bundles for full artifact packaging
- 📜 Vault documentation with scanner internals and build logs

## 📜 Philosophy

Privkeys.eth isn't just a scanner—it's a collectible entropy engine for builders who treat rare keys as lore fragments. It embraces terminal chaos, plugin modularity, and a roguelike hunt across keyspace. There are no trackers. No cloud hooks. No gatekeepers.

Launch it. Read the entropy. And if you catch a fragment—document it, name it, and contribute to the myth.

## 🤝 Contribute

Found a rare hit? Added a new HUD mode? Built your own plugin?  
Fork the relic, file a fragment pull, or drop your build back into the vault.

This is community-core entropy hunting. No central command—just scattered nodes building deeper rituals.
